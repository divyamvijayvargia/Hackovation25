Hackovation: Competition Rules & Git Workflow Guidelines
To ensure a fair and organized event, all participating teams are required to follow the code submission. 



Rule 1: 
Each team must push all code exclusively to their own assigned private repository. Pushing to another team's repository will result in immediate disqualification.


For your help:
I. Clone Your own Repository:
git clone <your-repository-url-goes-here>  -->This is the command for the same


II. Submit Your Code
To save and submit your work, run these three commands from your project folder. 

- git add .

make sure to commit the messages clean and understandable
- git commit -m "Your descriptive message about the changes"

- git push origin main
