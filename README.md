# Hackovation: Competition Rules & Git Workflow Guidelines

Welcome to **Hackovation** 🎉
To ensure a fair and organized event, all participating teams must strictly follow the code submission rules and Git workflow guidelines provided below.

## 📝 Competition Rules

**Rule 1:**

* Each team must **push all code exclusively to their own assigned private repository**.
* Pushing to another team's repository will result in **immediate disqualification**.

## ⚙️ Git Workflow Guidelines

### 1. Clone Your Repository

Use the command below to clone your assigned repository (replace with your repository URL):

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url-goes-here>
```

---

### 2. Submit Your Code

To save and submit your work, run the following commands from your project folder:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes with a clear and descriptive message
git commit -m "Your descriptive message about the changes"

# Push changes to the main branch
git push origin main
```

✅ **Important Notes:**

* Always write **clean and meaningful commit messages**.
* Do **not** push code to repositories other than your own team’s.

## 🚀 Best Practices

* Push your work **regularly** to avoid last-minute issues.
* Ensure your repository is well-organized with proper folder structure and documentation.
* Resolve merge conflicts responsibly within your team.
